## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the software
2. **Secure Configuration**: 
   - Use strong, unique stream keys
   - Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control
   - Use HTTPS in production environments
   - Implement proper firewall rules

3. **Environment Security**:
   - Run the application with minimal privileges
   - Use Docker for isolation when possible
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   - Regularly audit your streaming platform credentials

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**:
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` to check for known issues

3. **Secrets Management**:
   - Never hardcode secrets
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data
   - Implement proper key rotation

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### RTMP Stream Keys
- Stream keys are sensitive credentials
- They should be treated like passwords
- Rotate them regularly
- Monitor for unauthorized usage

### Network Security
- RTMP traffic is not encrypted by default
- Consider using RTMPS for encrypted streaming
- Implement proper network segmentation

### Web Dashboard
- Implement authentication for production use
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all user inputs

## 📋 Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] All default credentials changed
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for web interface
- [ ] Firewall rules properly configured
- [ ] Stream keys secured and rotated
- [ ] Dependencies updated to latest versions
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Logging and monitoring enabled
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures in place

## 🔍 Security Audit

We regularly conduct security audits and welcome external security assessments. If you're conducting a security audit, please:

1. Contact us before starting
2. Limit testing to your own instances
3. Do not access other users' data
4. Report findings responsibly

## 📞 Contact Information

For non-security issues, please use our regular support channels:
- GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests
- GitHub Discussions for questions
- Documentation for setup and usage help

For security issues only:
- Email: [security@yourproject.com]
- PGP Key: [Link to PGP key if available]

## 📄 Legal

By reporting security vulnerabilities, you agree to:
